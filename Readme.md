Game Info:

Pressure Plate game. 

The game will open to a set of black squares and a door. The squares represent the pressure plates. 

Tapping a correct plate in the sequence will change its colour to green. Tapping an incorrect one will change it to red. 

The puzzles are generated randomly, between 3-10 pressure plates.


Libraries Used:
SDL2 2.30.8
SDL2 TTF 2.22.0


How to run the game:

Open Release/game/Redly.exe


Future Expansion Ideas:

- have the 'incorrect' plates show an animation (eg: blink red for a moment) rather than stay red
- Track attempts (incorrect clicks) and add a Star-Rating system for how many attempts a puzzle took. 
- Difficulties with ranges of fewer to more plates 
- a defined list of puzzles and a selection screen, so they can be replayed easily.
- a timer the puzzle needs to be completed in, to ramp up difficulty
