Game Info:

Pressure Plate game. The game will open to a set of black squares and a door. The squares represent the pressure plates. Tapping a correct plate in the sequence will change its colour to green. Tapping an incorrect one will make it flash red briefly. Your current attempts count will be displayed on screen. The goal is to complete the puzzle with the least mis-clicked plates.

The puzzles are generated randomly, between 3-10 pressure plates.


Libraries Used:
SDL2 2.30.8
SDL2 TTF 2.22.0


How to run the game:

Open Release/Redly.exe


Future Expansion Ideas:

- Star-Rating system for how many attempts a puzzle took. 
- Difficulties with ranges of fewer to more plates 
- a defined list of puzzles and a selection screen, so they can be replayed easily.
